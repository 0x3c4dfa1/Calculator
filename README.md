# Modern Calculator

I created this calculator because I was bored and wanted to play around with Python and PyQt6. It's a modern, feature-rich calculator that supports basic arithmetic, scientific functions, and even a history of calculations.

## Features

- **Basic Calculator**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Scientific Calculator**: Includes trigonometric functions, logarithms, factorials, and more.
- **History Tab**: Keeps track of previous calculations. (It doenst stores it in a file, so be aware).
- **Keyboard Support**: Use your keyboard to enter numbers, operators, and commands.
- **Delete Functionality**: Easily delete characters from your input using the "DEL" button or Backspace key.

To run this calculator, you need to have Python installed. Then, install the required library with the following command:

```bash
pip install PyQt6
```

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0x3c4dfa1/Calculator
   ```

   ```
3. Run the calculator:
   ```bash

## Why I Made This

Honestly, I was bored and wanted to do something fun. Sick of the typical "tkinter" project, so I used "PyQt6".
